# MWA - Homework 01
You are in a technical interview for a fullstack engineer position:
1. The first question you will have to answer is explaining JS event loop, clarifying the synchronous and asynchronous parts, queues, priority, with examples. *Write your answer as if it were for a real interview.*
2. The follow up question is how may we convert a sync operation/function to become asynchronous?
